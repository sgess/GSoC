# Contributions to the PyDM Project
[PyDM](https://slaclab.github.io/pydm/) project is a multi-lab effort to provide a simple interface for creating control system displays. For this project, the student will create example tools and displays that explain how to use the PyDM toolset.

# 3D Printed Accelerators
3D printers can now be used to create metallic structures with precise tolerances. [Example structures](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2105/2105.13412.pdf) have already been built. The student will help create a code base for translating RF copper cavity design into a printer-readable format.

# Summarizing LINAC Data Acquisition 
Data Acquisition tools such as FACET DAQ [F2_DAQ](https://github.com/slaclab/facet-matlabTNG/tree/master/F2_DAQ) compile large amounts of data into discreet files. The student will extract metadata from the files and use the data to create an indexed, searchable database.

# Motion Control Systems with EtherCAT
[Ethercat](https://www.ethercat.org/default.htm) is an open framework for controlling devices linked by ethernet. For this project the student will develop software to control linear actuators.

# Real-Time Particle Accelerator Simulations
[LUME](https://github.com/ChristopherMayes/lume-impact-live-demo) is a framework for linking accelerator simulation codes to provide an end-to-end simulation of a particle accelerator. The student will develop tools that translate between the measured state of the accelerator and the inputs to a live simulation.
